        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>

            you would expect from a home-cooked meal. </p>
        <p> We are a proud, locally-owned family bakery, and we make our products from scratch everyday with love.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> As youngling, Mikalya enjoyed making a vast array of foods, much to her older sister's enjoyment.
            She had dreams of owning a bakery or restaurant, like her parents before her. Kirsten, happy to follow
            her sister's footstep, joined her in her endeavour. Cook's Bakery opened its doors in 1999, and has
            remained an integral part of college lives, providing students with a small 'taste of home.'</p>
